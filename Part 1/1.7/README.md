# Drawing Images

Whenever you use an application, you are sure to notice that images are involved.  
Even if the images can be made with shapes, it is generally best to use images.  

### Getting an Image
Lucky for you, I already have some files you can use.  
To get a simple, pixelated image of a chest, click on this (link)[https://github.com/Motirock/An-Introduction-To-Java-Graphics/blob/main/Resources/Images/chest.png] and press the download icon on the left.
