# Tutorials

These tutorials each cover a different part of using my template. If you want to get started right away, head to part 1.  
If you have feedback please leave it as an *ISSUE*. I will try to answer all reccomendations.  
The purpose of these tutorials is not to teach you how to make a game, but how to use my template to draw shapes, load images, apply transformations to images, play sounds, and take input in the form of keystrokes and mouse data.  
If you want to learn more about something in specific, you can try reccomending it to me, but you should first look it up. For pretty much everything you can think of there is a Stack Overflow question already posted about it.
