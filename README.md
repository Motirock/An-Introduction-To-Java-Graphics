# An Introduction To Java Graphics
## How to use:
This guide is broken up into Tutorials and a Template. The Template contains files that are used to create run an application more easily. The Tutorials folder is split into different parts. To navigate to different parts, navigate through the different folders and read each README for instructions. Each subfolder contains example programs that you can compile yourself and modify as you choose. You can download the entire repository for ease of use and offline learning. Alternatively (and more easily), you can use the table of contents below.  

## Table of Contents

Template:  
Download the repository and then transfer the files from the template folder into your own project folder. If you are having trouble, it may because the IDE you are using may require certain files for projects to work correctly. For example, in BlueJ, you must first create packages in the GUI and *then* transfer in your files.
