# Drawing Images

Whenever you use an application, you are sure to notice that images are involved.  
Even if the images can be made with shapes, it is generally best to use images.  

### Getting an Image
Lucky for you, I already have some files you can use.  
To get a simple, pixelated image of a chest, click on this [link](https://github.com/Motirock/An-Introduction-To-Java-Graphics/blob/main/Resources/Images/chest.png) and press the download icon on the right.  
Once it is downloaded, name it chest.png if it is not named so already.  

### Resources Folder

For our project, we will need a place to store assets. To do this, we will create a resources folder. 
In the folder that shares the game and main folder (this is likely the `src` folder), create a new `res` folder (the name matters).  
Next, drag the `chest.png` image into the `res` folder.
