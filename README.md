# An Introduction To Java Graphics
## How to use:
This guide is broken up into different parts. To navigate to different parts, navigate through the different folders and read each README for instructions. Each subfolder contains example programs that you can compile yourself and modify as you choose. You can download the entire repository for ease of use and offline learning. Alternatively (and more easily), you can use the table of contents below.

ADD TABLE OF CONTENTS, FIX LINKS BETWEEN SECTIONS
RENAME PART 4 to be "Part 4: Using the `update` Method" (change links in part 3)
